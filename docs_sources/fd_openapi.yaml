      description: |-
        This endpoint allows the creation, modification and deletion of [pushers](/client-server-api/#push-notifications)
        for this user ID. The behaviour of this endpoint varies depending on the
        values in the JSON body.

        If `kind` is not `null`, the pusher with this `app_id` and `pushkey`
        for this user is updated, or it is created if it doesn't exist. If
        `kind` is `null`, the pusher with this `app_id` and `pushkey` for this
        user is deleted.
