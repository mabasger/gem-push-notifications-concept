  data:
    type: object
    description: |-
      Required if `kind` is not `null`. A dictionary of information
      for the pusher implementation itself.

      If `kind` is `http`, this MUST contain `url` which is the URL
      to use for sending notifications. Clients MAY use this object
      to pass custom data to their push gateway. Servers MUST forward
      the entire content including `format` and any custom keys but excluding `url`
      when calling [`/push/v1/notify`](/push-gateway-api/#postpushv1notify).

          Required if `kind` is `http`. The URL to use for sending
          notifications. MUST be an HTTPS URL with a path of
          `/push/v1/notify`.

        type: string
        description: |-
          The format to send notifications in to Push Gateways if the
          `kind` is `http`. The details about what fields the
          homeserver should send to the push gateway are defined in the
          [Push Gateway Specification](/push-gateway-api/). Currently the only format
          available is 'event_id_only'.
  append:
    type: boolean
    description: |-
      If true, the FD should add another pusher with the
      given pushkey and App ID in addition to any others with
      different user IDs. Otherwise, the homeserver must remove any
      other pushers with the same App ID and pushkey for different
      users. The default is `false`.
