      type: string
      description: |-
        This is a unique identifier for this pusher. The value you
        should use for this is the routing or destination address
        information for the notification, for example, the APNS token
        for APNS or the Registration ID for GCM. If your notification
        client has no such concept, use any unique identifier.
        Max length, 512 bytes.

        If the `kind` is `"email"`, this is the email address to
        send notifications to.
    kind:
      description: |-
        The kind of pusher to configure. `"http"` makes a pusher that
        sends HTTP pokes. `"email"` makes a pusher that emails the
        user with unread notifications. `null` deletes the pusher.
      value: null
    app_id:
      type: string
      description: |-
        This is a reverse-DNS style identifier for the application.
        It is recommended that this end with the platform, such that
        different platform versions get different app identifiers.
        Max length, 64 chars.

        If the `kind` is `"email"`, this is `"m.email"`.
    app_display_name:
      type: string
      description: |-
        Required if `kind` is not `null`. A string that will allow the
        user to identify what application owns this pusher.
    device_display_name:
      type: string
      description: |-
        Required if `kind` is not `null`. A string that will allow the
        user to identify what device owns this pusher.
    profile_tag:
      type: string
      description: |-
        This string determines which set of device specific rules this
        pusher executes.
    lang:
      type: string
      description: |-
        Required if `kind` is not `null`. The preferred language for
        receiving notifications (e.g. 'en' or 'en-US').
    data:
      type: object
      description: |-
        Required if `kind` is not `null`. A dictionary of information
        for the pusher implementation itself.

        If `kind` is `http`, this MUST contain `url` which is the URL
        to use for sending notifications. Clients MAY use this object
        to pass custom data to their push gateway. Servers MUST forward
        the entire content including `format` and any custom keys but excluding `url`
        when calling [`/_matrix/push/v1/notify`](/push-gateway-api/#post_matrixpushv1notify).

            Required if `kind` is `http`. The URL to use for sending
            notifications. MUST be an HTTPS URL with a path of

          description: |-
            The format to send notifications in to Push Gateways if the
            `kind` is `http`. The details about what fields the
            homeserver should send to the push gateway are defined in the
            [Push Gateway Specification](/push-gateway-api/). Currently the only format
            available is 'event_id_only'.
    append:
      type: boolean
      description: |-
        If true, the homeserver should add another pusher with the
        given pushkey and App ID in addition to any others with
        different user IDs. Otherwise, the homeserver must remove any
        other pushers with the same App ID and pushkey for different
        users. The default is `false`.
